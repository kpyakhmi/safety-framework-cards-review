# Safety Framework Cards
Live Demo Rendered cards and side-by-side comparison view: https://safety-frameworks-cards-review.netlify.app/ 
A standardized specification for documenting frontier AI safety commitments.

Frontier AI labs publish public safety frameworks (Anthropic's RSP, OpenAI's Preparedness Framework, Google DeepMind's FSF, Meta's Outcomes-Led Framework, and others). Each framework is published as prose in idiosyncratic structure. **A Safety Framework Card is a machine-readable companion** that documents a framework's structural commitments along six dimensions, so regulators, partners, and researchers can compare frameworks systematically.

This is an *additive* artifact — it does not replace the framework. A lab maps its existing framework into the schema in roughly thirty minutes. The card is then validated, rendered to HTML, and diffed across versions.

## Quick start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install pyyaml jsonschema

# Validate a single card
python validator/safety_card.py lint cards/anthropic-rsp.yaml

# Validate every card
python validator/safety_card.py lint cards/

# Render all cards as a static site (index + per-card + comparison view)
python renderer/render.py site cards/ -o docs/

# Render a side-by-side comparison
python renderer/render.py compare cards/anthropic-rsp.yaml cards/openai-preparedness.yaml -o compare.html

# Diff two versions of the same lab's card
python renderer/render.py diff cards/anthropic-rsp-v1.yaml cards/anthropic-rsp-v2.yaml -o diff.html
```

## The six dimensions

A Safety Framework Card captures the structural anatomy of a frontier safety framework along six dimensions corresponding to the questions any framework must answer:

| | Dimension | What it captures |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Risk Ontology | Which harms the framework names as in-scope (CBRN, cyber, autonomy, etc.) |
| D2 | Capability Thresholds | How dangerous-capability levels are operationalized (tiers, scores) |
| D3 | Evaluation Methodology | What evidence determines threshold crossings (eval sources, types, cadence) |
| D4 | Mitigation Commitments | What responses are triggered (technical, access, operational, halting) |
| D5 | Governance Triggers | Who decides and how (decision body, external review, disclosure) |
| D6 | Revision Protocol | How the framework itself changes (cadence, ratchet, public diff) |

Each dimension has 3–7 controlled-vocabulary sub-axes. See `schema/safety_framework_card.schema.json` for the formal definition.

## How to publish a card for your lab

1. Copy `schema/template.yaml` to `cards/<your-lab>.yaml`.
2. Fill in the metadata header and every required field.
3. Fill recommended fields where applicable. The validator scores completeness.
4. Run `python validator/safety_card.py lint cards/<your-lab>.yaml` and address any warnings.
5. Set `notes.verification_status` to `publisher_verified` when an authorized representative has confirmed the card's accuracy.
6. Open a pull request, or publish the card in your own repository.

## Status

**Spec version: 0.1** — initial draft. Public comment is open via GitHub issues.

**Reference cards in this repository are marked `verification_status: draft`** pending publisher confirmation. Cards are based on public framework documents and should not be cited as authoritative until verified by the publishing lab. Each card's `notes.open_questions` field flags assertions requiring confirmation.

## Contributing

This is an early-stage open specification. We welcome:

- **Lab-published cards** for any frontier framework, with `publisher_verified` status.
- **Schema feedback** via GitHub issues. v0.2 will incorporate community feedback after a 30-day comment period.
- **Independent verification** of any reference card. PRs that update a card with verified information are particularly welcome.
- **Translation or rendering tools** building on the schema.

## Acknowledgments

Independent work. Grateful to the frontier-lab safety teams and the METR, Apollo, GovAI, and FMF communities whose public documents and comparative reviews made this synthesis possible. Individual acknowledgments will be added as reference cards are verified by their publishing labs.
